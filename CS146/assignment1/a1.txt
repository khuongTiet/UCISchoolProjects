	You are not allowed to create files in a directory if you removed permissions
	for yourself on it. You cannot do any executions either such as "cd", "ls",
	or "ls -l"

6.
	If you make a hard link to a file and then remove the original file, the 
	contents of that files are not actually removed because there is still a
	reference to that file via the hard link. If you make a symbolic link then
	the contents of that file will actually be removed.

7.
	You are allowed to "mv" and "cp" a directory. To "mv" a directory you simply just
	use the command and specify a new location for the direction. In order to "cp" a
	directory, you will need to pass the "-r" option in order for it to happen 
	recursively and copy all the files and subdirectories within that directory.

	1100101 00000000 11111111 11011100

	MOVE -> 1100101
	MUL  -> 1010001 01011101
